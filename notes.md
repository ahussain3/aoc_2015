# Learning Notes

Haskell is nice when you have a single unit of work, but is a little more
fiddly when it comes to data manipulation. E.g. there are no 'for' loops so
I found myself needing to do maps of maps.


Questions:
- Is there a "spread" operator? Such that I can pass a [Int] of length 3
  into a function that takes Int -> Int -> Int as input?
- How can I map over the interior items in a list of lists?
